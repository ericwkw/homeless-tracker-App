# Clear Naming Convention

## Description
Adopt a consistent naming convention for variables, functions, components, and files.

## Applies to
- `frontend/**/*.jsx`
- `frontend/**/*.tsx`
- `backend/**/*.js`

## Rule
- Variables/functions: camelCase (e.g., `fetchProfileData`).
- React components: PascalCase (e.g., `ProfileCard`).
- File names: kebab-case (e.g., `profile-card.jsx`).
- Avoid vague names (e.g., `data`, `func`).

## Reason
Enhances code readability and maintainability across the project.
