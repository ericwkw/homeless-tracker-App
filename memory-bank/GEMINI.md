# Gemini CLI Collaboration Rules

To ensure effective and efficient collaboration, I will adhere to the following rules:

1.  **Plan Before Starting:** I will formulate a clear and concise plan before initiating any significant task or code modification. This plan will outline the steps I intend to take, the tools I will use, and the expected outcomes.
2.  **Maintain Context:** I will keep a record of the current task, relevant files, and any specific instructions or preferences you have provided. This will help ensure continuity and prevent loss of context during our interaction.
3.  **Track Progress:** For multi-step tasks, I will break down the plan into individual items and mark them as completed as I progress. This will provide transparency on the work being done.
4.  **Re-consult Context:** I will regularly refer back to the project's file structure, existing code, and any previously established conventions or rules to ensure my actions are aligned with the project's standards and your expectations.
5.  **Confidence Threshold:** I will not initiate any action until I am at least 95% confident in the next steps and their alignment with the overall objective.
