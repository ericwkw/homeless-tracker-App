# Implementation Plan  
## Project Title: Homeless Tracker App  
**Date:** April 01, 2025  
**Version:** 1.1  

---

## Overview  
This implementation plan outlines the steps to build the Homeless Tracker App using the specified tech stack and adhering to the Cursor rules. The focus is on delivering core functionality first (profiles, QR check-ins, community reporting, and map display), with additional features (e.g., advanced analytics) deferred to later phases. Each step includes a simple test to verify completion.

## Phase 1: Setup and Core Infrastructure  

### Step 1: Project Setup  
- **Task:** Initialize the project structure, install dependencies, and configure version control.  
- **Details:**  
  - Create `frontend/` (React) and `backend/` (Node.js/Express) directories.
  - Prioritize responsive web with mobile-first approach.
  - Run `npm init` and install core packages (e.g., `react`, `express`, `pg`).  
  - Set up Git repository and commit initial structure.  
- **Test:** Run `npm start` in both `frontend/` and `backend/` to ensure no errors.  
- **Duration:** 1 day  

### Step 2: Database Setup  
- **Task:** Set up PostgreSQL and create initial tables for profiles and check-ins.  
- **Details:**  
  - Install PostgreSQL locally or use a hosted service (e.g., Heroku Postgres).
  - Enable PostGIS extension for geospatial functionality.
  - Create tables:  
    - `profiles` (id, first_name, last_name, nickname, dob, awaiting_hospital, awaiting_shelter, employed, temp_shelter).  
    - `checkins` (id, profile_id, location, timestamp).
    - `volunteers` (id, name, email, assigned_individuals).
  - Add sample data (e.g., 2-3 profiles).  
- **Test:** Run a query (e.g., `SELECT * FROM profiles`) in `psql` or a DB client to retrieve sample data.  
- **Duration:** 1-2 days

## Phase 2: Core Backend Functionality  

### Step 3: Authentication System
- **Task:** Set up JWT-based authentication system with role-based permissions.
- **Details:**
  - Create user roles: admin (project owner), volunteer, and community reporter.
  - Implement JWT token generation and validation middleware.
  - Set up secure password storage with bcrypt.
  - Add endpoints for login, logout, and token refresh.
- **Test:** Generate a JWT token for different user roles and verify access restrictions.
- **Duration:** 2-3 days

### Step 4: Basic Profile API  
- **Task:** Build Express routes to manage profiles (CRUD operations).  
- **Details:**  
  - Create `backend/routes/profiles.js` with `GET /profiles`, `POST /profiles`, `GET /profiles/:id`.  
  - Use parameterized queries (per `parameterized-queries.mdc`).  
  - Connect to PostgreSQL using `pg` library.
  - Implement standardized error handling with Express middleware.
- **Test:** Use Postman or `curl` to:  
  - `POST` a new profile and verify it's added to the DB.  
  - `GET /profiles` and confirm the response lists profiles.  
- **Duration:** 2-3 days  

### Step 5: QR Check-In API  
- **Task:** Implement an endpoint to log QR code check-ins.  
- **Details:**  
  - Add `POST /checkins` in `backend/routes/checkins.js` to accept `profile_id` and `location` (lat/long).  
  - Generate QR codes using `qrcode` library and store mappings (e.g., QR ID to `profile_id`).
  - Include an endpoint for volunteers to request new QR codes for individuals.
  - Standardize geocoding using PostGIS with EPSG:4326 (WGS84) coordinate system.
  - Record check-in data in the `checkins` table.
  - Support offline data collection with timestamp tracking.
- **Test:** Send a `POST /checkins` request with sample data and verify the entry in the `checkins` table.  
- **Duration:** 3-4 days  

### Step 6: Community Reporting API  
- **Task:** Add an endpoint for community members to submit reports.  
- **Details:**  
  - Create `POST /reports` in `backend/routes/reports.js` to accept `profile_id`, `location`, and `status` updates.  
  - Store in a new `reports` table (id, profile_id, location, status, timestamp).  
  - Add JWT authentication with role verification.
  - Implement data privacy measures including data minimization and purpose limitation.
- **Test:** Authenticate with a token, send a `POST /reports` request, and confirm the report is saved in the DB.  
- **Duration:** 2-3 days

## Phase 3: Core Frontend Functionality  

### Step 7: Profile Management UI  
- **Task:** Build a basic React interface to view and add profiles.  
- **Details:**  
  - Create `frontend/components/ProfileList.jsx` and `ProfileForm.jsx` (functional components per `functional-components.mdc`).  
  - Fetch data from `GET /profiles` and post to `POST /profiles`.  
  - Split into separate files (per `modularity.mdc`).
  - Implement responsive mobile-first design.
  - Add offline data caching using IndexedDB or localStorage.
- **Test:** Load the app in a browser, add a profile via the form, and verify it appears in the list.  
- **Duration:** 3-4 days  

### Step 8: QR Check-In Interface  
- **Task:** Add a QR scanning feature to log check-ins.  
- **Details:**  
  - Use a web-compatible library like `jsQR` to scan QR codes.  
  - Send scanned data to `POST /checkins`.  
  - Support offline scanning with local data storage.
  - Display a confirmation message on success.
  - Implement error handling with user-friendly messages.
- **Test:** Scan a generated QR code and verify the check-in is recorded in the backend.  
- **Duration:** 3-4 days  

### Step 9: Map Visualization  
- **Task:** Display check-in and report locations on a map.  
- **Details:**  
  - Integrate Google Maps API in `frontend/components/MapView.jsx`.  
  - Fetch data from `GET /checkins` and `GET /reports`, plot markers.  
  - Optimize with `React.memo` (per `map-optimization.mdc`).
  - Implement clustering for dense marker areas.
  - Add offline map support with cached map tiles.
- **Test:** Load the map, check that markers appear for sample check-ins and reports.  
- **Duration:** 3-4 days

## Phase 4: Integration and Polish  

### Step 10: Community Reporting UI  
- **Task:** Add a form for community members to submit reports.

  - Post to `POST /reports` with JWT auth header.  
  - Implement offline support for report submissions.
  - Show success feedback.
  - Include clear consent and privacy notices.
- **Test:** Submit a report as an authenticated user and verify it appears on the map.  
- **Duration:** 2-3 days  

### Step 11: Basic Area Analysis  
- **Task:** Implement a simple count of individuals in an area.  
- **Details:**  
  - Add a filter in `MapView.jsx` to count profiles within a radius (e.g., 1km) based on check-ins/reports.  
  - Display the count on the UI.
  - Implement adoption rate tracking to measure success.
  - Add user feedback collection interface.
- **Test:** Select an area on the map and confirm the count matches the number of visible markers.  
- **Duration:** 2-3 days  

### Step 12: Testing and User Acceptance
- **Task:** Implement comprehensive testing strategy and conduct user acceptance testing.
- **Details:**
  - Add unit tests for critical backend functions.
  - Implement integration tests for the API endpoints.
  - Conduct end-to-end testing with real devices.
  - Organize user acceptance testing with volunteers and community reporters.
- **Test:** Run automated test suite and verify passing tests.
- **Duration:** 3-4 days

  - Configure Heroku app with PostgreSQL add-on.  
  - Push backend code and set environment variables (e.g., DB credentials, JWT secret).
  - Implement SSL for secure data transmission.
  - Set up database backups and monitoring.
- **Test:** Hit deployed endpoints (e.g., `GET /profiles`) from Postman and verify responses.  
- **Duration:** 1-2 days

- **Mobile-First Approach:** The web application will be designed with responsive mobile-first principles for optimal use on smartphones.
- **Offline Support:** The app will support offline data collection with synchronization once connectivity is restored.
- **Feedback Collection:** Regular meetings with community reporters (twice monthly) and homeless individuals (weekly) will inform ongoing development.
- **Success Metrics:** Adoption rate will be the primary KPI for measuring success.
- **Cursor Rules:** Applied throughout (e.g., modularity in file structure, functional components in React).
