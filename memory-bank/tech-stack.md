## Overview
This tech stack is designed to meet the requirements of the Homeless Tracker App, focusing on rapid development, scalability, and cross-platform compatibility for both web and mobile.

---

## Backend & Database
- **Technology:** Supabase
- **Purpose:** Provides a managed PostgreSQL database, authentication, real-time subscriptions, and storage.
- **Rationale:**
  - **Rapid Development:** Offers out-of-the-box solutions for common backend needs, significantly reducing development time.
  - **Scalability:** Built on cloud infrastructure, ensuring the application can scale with user growth.
  - **Real-time Capabilities:** Enables live updates for map data and reports.
  - **Authentication:** Handles user authentication and management securely.

## Web Frontend & API
- **Technology:** Next.js (React Framework)
- **Purpose:** For building the responsive web application and handling server-side logic via API routes.
- **Rationale:**
  - **Unified Development:** Allows building both frontend and backend API routes within a single codebase.
  - **Performance:** Supports Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG) for improved performance and SEO.
  - **Developer Experience:** Excellent tooling and a strong community.

## Mobile Frontend
- **Technology:** Expo (React Native Framework)
- **Purpose:** For building cross-platform mobile applications (iOS and Android) from a single codebase.
- **Rationale:**
  - **Mobile Accessibility:** Crucial for features like QR code scanning and community reporting on mobile devices.
  - **Single Codebase:** Significantly reduces development time and effort compared to separate native apps.
  - **Simplified Tooling:** Abstracts away complex native build environments.

## Deployment
- **Technology:** Vercel
- **Purpose:** For seamless, automatic deployment of the Next.js web application.
- **Rationale:**
  - **Zero-Config Deployment:** Integrates perfectly with Next.js for automatic deployments upon Git pushes.
  - **Global CDN:** Ensures fast content delivery worldwide.
  - **Serverless Functions:** Next.js API routes deploy as serverless functions, handling backend logic efficiently.

## Mapping
- **Technology:** Google Maps API (via `@react-google-maps/api` for web, potentially similar for mobile)
- **Purpose:** To display check-in and report locations on an interactive map.
- **Rationale:**
  - **Familiarity & Features:** Widely used, robust mapping solution with rich features for visualization.
  - **Integration:** Good library support for React and React Native environments.

## QR Code Scanning
- **Technology:** `jsqr` (for web) and `expo-barcode-scanner` (for mobile)
- **Purpose:** To enable scanning of QR codes for check-ins.
- **Rationale:**
  - **Platform-Specific Optimization:** Uses appropriate libraries for web and mobile environments to ensure optimal performance and user experience.
