**Date:** April 01, 2025  
**Version:** 1.0  

---

## Overview  
This tech stack is designed to meet the requirements of the Homeless Tracker App, focusing on simplicity, reliability, and compatibility with the hybrid QR code check-in and community reporting system.

---

## Frontend  
- **Technology:** React (Web) + React Native (Mobile)  
- **Purpose:** Build an interactive, map-based interface for web and mobile platforms.  
- **Rationale:**  
  - Single codebase for web and mobile simplifies development.  
  - Large ecosystem with libraries for maps (e.g., Google Maps integration).  
  - Easy to create user-friendly dashboards and forms.  

## Backend  
- **Technology:** Node.js with Express  
- **Purpose:** Handle API requests for QR check-ins, community reports, and data retrieval.  
- **Rationale:**  
  - Lightweight and fast for real-time data processing.  
  - JavaScript-based, aligning with frontend for consistency.  
  - Robust package ecosystem (e.g., npm) for quick feature additions.  

## Database  
- **Technology:** PostgreSQL  
- **Purpose:** Store individual profiles, check-in logs, and community reports securely.  
- **Rationale:**  
  - Reliable relational database with geospatial support (PostGIS).  
  - Simple schema design for structured data.  
  - ACID compliance ensures data integrity.  

## Mapping  
- **Technology:** Google Maps API (or OpenStreetMap)  
- **Purpose:** Provide map visualization with zoom, markers, and heatmaps.  
- **Rationale:**  
  - Easy integration with React via libraries.  
  - Reliable and accurate mapping solution.  
  - OpenStreetMap as a free alternative if budget is constrained.  

## QR Code Generation & Scanning  
- **Technology:** qrcode (Node.js library) + ZXing (scanning)  
- **Purpose:** Generate unique QR codes and enable scanning at check-in points.  
- **Rationale:**  
  - Simple tools for creating and reading QR codes.  
  - Integrates seamlessly with mobile app camera functionality.  
  - Lightweight and dependable.  

## Hosting/Deployment  
- **Technology:** Heroku (Backend) + Netlify (Frontend)  
- **Purpose:** Host the backend API/database and frontend application.  
- **Rationale:**  
  - Heroku simplifies Node.js and PostgreSQL deployment.  
  - Netlify offers easy hosting for React apps with automatic scaling.  
  - Minimal DevOps required, ideal for small teams.  

## Authentication/Security  
- **Technology:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)  
- **Purpose:** Secure API endpoints and user access for reporters.  
- **Rationale:**  
  - Simple, stateless authentication system.  
  - Easy to implement with Express.  
  - Ensures data privacy and restricted access.
